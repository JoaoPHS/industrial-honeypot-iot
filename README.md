## 🎯 Overview

This honeypot is a security demonstration that simulates ICS/SCADA environments to detect and analyze attacks in real time. Developed in C++17 with Boost.Asio, it offers industrial-grade performance for protecting critical infrastructures. As a demonstration, it is ideal for cybersecurity enthusiasts, students, professionals, and SOC teams to study. It can also serve as a basis for developing a more robust honeypot, adding new functionalities, configurations, adding a dashboard, or integrating with other projects.

A highly interactive honeypot for detecting attacks on critical industrial infrastructures, developed in C++17 with a focus on performance and structured logging for SOCs. It is very important to develop applications at an industrial level because, as we saw in the case of Jaguar Land Rover, a manufacturing shutdown due to a hacker attack can generate losses of billions of dollars and even lead to bankruptcy.

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 Installation

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu), Raspberry Pi OS or Raspberry Pi >= 4 (physical device)
- GCC 8+ or Clang 6+
- CMake 3.16+
- Boost 1.66+

### 📦 Method 1: Native Compilation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JoaoPHS/iot-industrial-honeypot.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd iot-industrial-honeypot/build

# Configure and compile
rm -rf *
cmake ..
make

# Run the server
./iot_honeypot_server

```

### 🔧 Method 2: Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t iot-honeypot .

# Run container
docker run -p 502:502 -p 5683:5683/udp iot-honeypot

##⚡ Method 3: Raspberry Pi

bash
# Install dependencies on Raspberry Pi
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
build-essential \
cmake \
libboost-system-dev \
libboost-thread-dev

# Compile normally
rm -rf * 
  or (If that doesn't work, follow the procedure below)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
./iot_honeypot_server
```
## 🎮 How to Use

### 🖥️ First Steps

Start the server:

```bash
./iot_honeypot_server
```
Monitor the logs in another terminal:

```bash
tail -f logs/honeypot_soc.json
```

### 🔍 Performing Tests

#### Modbus Test:
```bash
# Basic connection
nc localhost 502

# Multiple connections
for i in {1..5}; do echo "TEST" | nc localhost 502; done
```
#### CoAP Test:
```bash
# Explicit IPv4 (always works)
echo "SCAN" | nc -u 127.0.0.1 5683 -w 1

# With socat (recommended)
echo "TEST" | socat - UDP:localhost:5683
```
### 📊 Detailed Mode

#### The server operates in detailed mode by default, displaying:

- >>>>> Established connections
- >>>>>> Received requests
- >>>>>>> Detected attacks
- >>>>>>>> Real-time statistics

### ⚙️ Advanced Settings

#### Custom Ports:

```cpp
// In main.cpp
ModbusServer modbus_server(io_context, 1502); // Alternative port
CoAPServer coap_server(io_context, 15683); // Alternative port
```
Custom Logging:

```cpp
// Initialize with custom file
SOCLogger::initialize("custom_logs.json");
```

### 💾 Exporting Data

#### Logs are automatically saved to:

```bash
build/logs/honeypot_soc.json
```
#### For SIEM integration:

```bash
# Example: Send to Elasticsearch tail -f logs/honeypot_soc.json | while read line; of 
curl -X POST elasticsearch:9200/honeypot/_doc -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$line"
done
```
